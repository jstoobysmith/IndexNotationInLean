# Index Notation In Lean

This is a draft manuscript discussing the implementation of index notation into Lean 4. 
The actual implementation can be found as part of [HepLean](https://github.com/HEPLean/HepLean).

All the material here is very likely to change (at this stage there are many many typos 
and spelling mistakes).
