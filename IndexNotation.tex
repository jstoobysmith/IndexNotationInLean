\begin{abstract}
Index notation is tool commonly used in physics to manipulate tensors.
In physics, we use index notation for three different types of tensors: 
Einstein tensors (e.g., ordinary vectors and matrices), Lorentz tensors, and 
Van der Waerden tensors. In this paper, we discuss how these are implemented in Lean 4 using a 
general mathematical theory based on category theory, and related to the notation of an operad.
\end{abstract}


\section{Overview}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{overviewFlow.png}

Index notation in Lean, and really in any language including pen and paper, involves three steps:
\section{Color}

One of the key features of our construction will be the notation of a color. 
A color is a property associated to an index.  
To start with an example, Lorentz tensors have two colors up and down, in other words an 
index can be an up-index or a down-index. Einstien tensors only have one index, and 
Van der Waerden tensors have six colors; two for left-handed fermions, two for right-handed 
fermions, and two for four-vector indices. 

We generically denote by $C$ the type of colors. As an example, for
Lorentz tensors $C = {up, down}$. 

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the category of types (or sets). The category $\mathcal{S}_{/C}$ is the 
category 
of types over $C$, that is whose objects are maps $X\to C$ and whose morphisms from 
$X\to C$ to $Y\to C$ are maps $X\to Y$ making the obvious triangle diagram commutes. 

The core of $\mathcal{S}_{/C}$, denoted $\mathcal{S}_{/C}^\times$, can be thought of as the 
category of indexing sets of tensors of a given type. We will see this made manifest with 
a symmetric monoidal functor later.
